## 1. Project Overview

The **mollerdb** project is a high-performance, dual-language Software Development Kit (SDK) for accessing the MOLLER experiment's analysis database. MOLLER (Measurement Of a Lepton Lepton Electroweak Reaction) is a precision physics experiment at Jefferson Lab that will measure parity-violating asymmetry in electron-electron scattering. This SDK provides convenient access to the experiment's database for collaborators who may not be proficient in SQL.

## 2. Core Design Decisions

### 2.1. Overall SDK Architecture
The SDK will support both C++ and Python users without duplicating core logic. The chosen architecture is:
- **C++ Core Library (`libmollerdb`)**: A central, high-performance C++ library that contains all database interaction logic.
- **Python Bindings**: A thin wrapper around the C++ core, exposing its functionality to Python.

### 2.2. Key Technologies
- **Build System**: `scikit-build-core` was chosen as the modern PEP 517 build backend. It will orchestrate the build process by invoking CMake. This replaces an earlier suggestion of using `setuptools` with a custom `CMakeBuild` class.
- **C++ Database Driver**: `sqlpp23` is the designated library for connecting to and interacting with the PostgreSQL database from C++. It was chosen over `libpqxx` because it is a header-only library with fewer dependencies, making it more platform-independent and easier to manage. It will be included as a git submodule.
- **Python Bindings**: `pybind11` is the standard tool chosen to create the bindings between C++ and Python.
- **Data Interchange Format**: **Apache Arrow** was identified as the critical technology for efficient, zero-copy data transfer between the C++ core and Python. C++ functions will query the database and construct Arrow `Table` objects, which can be converted to Pandas DataFrames in Python with minimal overhead.

### 2.3. Naming and Structure
After some discussion, the following naming convention was finalized for consistency:
- **Repository**: `JeffersonLab/mollerdb`
- **Python Package Name**: `mollerdb`
- **Compiled Python Module**: `mollerdb` (This is the `.so` or `.pyd` file generated by `pybind11`).
- The final Python package structure will be located in `python/mollerdb/`.

## 3. Associated Database Schema Design

The SDK design was informed by a proposed redesign of the underlying database schema (`qwparity_schema.dbml`). Key schema suggestions include:
- **Unified Results Table**: Merging detector-specific tables (`md_data`, `lumi_data`, `beam`) into a single, flexible `results` table.
- **Generalized Sensitivities Table**: Abstracting "slopes" into a generic `sensitivities` table to store any linear correlation (detector-monitor, detector-detector, etc.). This requires a master `quantity` lookup table.
- **Versioning**: Adding versioning (e.g., `valid_from_run`, `valid_to_run`) to detector and quantity tables to ensure long-term reproducibility.

## 5. Development Guidelines

### 5.1. Building the Project

**Python Package:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

**C++ Library (via CMake):**
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 5.2. Git Submodules
The project uses git submodules for dependencies like sqlpp23. Always ensure submodules are initialized:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 5.3. Code Style
- Follow the existing code style in each file
- C++ code uses C++23 standard (as specified in CMakeLists.txt)
- Python code should follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Keep the C++ core focused on database operations
- Keep Python bindings thin and delegate to C++ core

### 5.4. Data Flow
1. C++ functions query the database using sqlpp23
2. Results are converted to Apache Arrow `Table` objects
3. Arrow tables are passed to Python with zero-copy
4. Python users can convert Arrow tables to Pandas DataFrames

### 5.5. Naming Conventions
- **Python Package**: `mollerdb`
- **Compiled Module**: `mollerdb`
- **C++ Namespace**: `mollerdb`
- Use snake_case for Python code
- Use camelCase for C++ code (following existing conventions)

## 6. Dependencies

### 6.1. C++ Dependencies
- sqlpp23 (git submodule)
- Apache Arrow C++ library
- PostgreSQL client library (libpq)
- pybind11

### 6.2. Python Dependencies
- scikit-build-core (build)
- pybind11 (build)
- pyarrow (runtime - for Arrow table interaction)
- pandas (optional - for DataFrame conversion in user code and examples)

## 7. CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration (see `.github/workflows/`). When modifying code:
- Ensure builds pass on supported platforms
- Git submodules must be checked out in CI workflows
- Both C++ and Python components should be tested

## 8. Common Tasks

### 8.1. Adding a New Database Query Function
1. Implement the C++ function in `src/Database.cpp`
2. Use sqlpp23 for database interaction
3. Return results as Arrow `Table` objects
4. Expose the function in `python/bindings.cpp` using pybind11
5. Update Python package `__init__.py` if needed

### 8.2. Modifying Build Configuration
- C++ build: Edit `CMakeLists.txt`
- Python package: Edit `pyproject.toml`
- Dependencies: Update both files as needed

### 8.3. Working with Arrow Tables
- Construct Arrow tables in C++ using the Arrow C++ API
- Pass table pointers through pybind11
- Python receives Arrow tables that can be converted to Pandas DataFrames

## 9. Important Notes

- **Minimal Changes**: Make the smallest possible changes to achieve goals
- **Testing**: Run existing tests before and after changes
- **Dependencies**: Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- **Platform Independence**: Keep code portable (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Performance**: The C++ core is designed for high performance; maintain this in all changes
- **Documentation**: Update README.md and docstrings when changing public APIs

## 10. Security Considerations

- Never commit database credentials or connection strings
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate all database inputs to prevent SQL injection (sqlpp23 provides protection)
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## 11. Next Steps

The project is ready for ongoing development:
1. **Implementing Core Logic**: Flesh out the `src/Database.cpp` file to perform actual database queries using `sqlpp23`.
2. **Integrating Apache Arrow**: Add the logic to build Arrow `Table` objects from the query results and implement the C++-to-Python type conversions for these tables.
3. **CI/CD Setup**: Create a GitHub Actions workflow to build and test the C++ and Python components on various platforms, ensuring all dependencies (`arrow`) are correctly handled. The workflow must ensure git submodules are checked out to provide `sqlpp23`.
4. **Documentation and Examples**: Expand the `README.md` and add an `examples/` directory showing how to use the SDK in both Python and C++.
